          I build dashboards that make numbers talk (and trust me, they have opinions), automate the boring stuff because life's too short for manual data entry, and turn messy datasets into crystal-clear business insights that don't require a PhD to understand. Whether it's optimizing city projects or figuring out why the coffee machine usage spikes every Tuesday at 2:47 PM, I love connecting data to real-world impact that actually helps people. Outside of work, I'm outdoorsy, endlessly curious, and always learning random new things that allegedly have nothing to do with data (spoiler alert: they somehow always circle back to it – I might start learning pottery and end up analyzing clay moisture content patterns, it's a gift really). Let's make numbers less scary and more powerful, one insight at a time.
