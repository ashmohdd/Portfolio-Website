            I build dashboards that make numbers talk (and trust me, they have opinions). I automate the boring stuff because life's too short for manual data entry, and turn messy datasets into crystal-clear insights that don't require a PhD to understand.

            Whether I'm optimizing city projects or investigating why coffee machine usage spikes every Tuesday at 2:47 PM, I love connecting data to real-world impact that actually helps people. Outside of work, I'm that person who somehow finds patterns in everything â€“ hiking trails, pizza topping preferences, the way my neighbors walk their dogs. I can't help it; my brain just sees the world in spreadsheets now.

            Let's make numbers less scary and more powerful, one insight at a time.
