              I build dashboards that make numbers talk (and trust me, they have opinions), automate the boring stuff because life's too short for manual data entry, and turn messy datasets into crystal-clear business insights that don't require a PhD to understand.
            </p>
            <p className="para">
              Whether it's optimizing city projects or figuring out why the coffee machine usage spikes every Tuesday at 2:47 PM, I love connecting data to real-world impact that actually helps people.

              Outside of work, I'm outdoorsy, endlessly curious, and always learning random new things that allegedly have nothing to do with data (spoiler alert: they somehow always circle back to it â€“ I might start learning pottery and end up analyzing clay moisture content patterns, it's a gift really).
