          A data whisperer by day, and Shawarma connoisseur by night ðŸŒ®
          I build dashboards that make numbers talk, automate boring stuff, and turn messy datasets into crystal-clear business insights.
          Whether it's boosting school performance or optimizing city projects, I love connecting data to real-world impact.
          Outside of work? I'm outdoorsy, curious, and always learning new things that have nothing to do with data (but somehow always come back to it).
          Let's make numbers less scary and more powerful.
